    "\n",
    "To determine the message which will likely lead to the highest probability of purchase, we followed the following pipeline: \n",
    "\n",
    "> 1) Built a logistic regression with interactions, so that it is flexible to allow for customization of messages.    \n",
    "> 2) Predict the probability of purchase for each message for each customer.    \n",
    "> 3) Determine the message with the highest predicted probability of purchase, and store that message *(as offer)* and the value *(as target)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for customization of messages, we recognize that that different offers may work better for different customers. In other words, we want to customize messages because we think that there might be an interaction between (1) who the customer is and (2) how effective the offered message is. Hence, we need to interact `message type` with the variables that describe customer characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "This was how we built the logistic regression model, which had an AUC score of `88.17%` and `88.15%` for the testing and training sets respectively. The results of the prediction were 7 probabilities for each customer, 1 for each of the 7 messages. From these probabilities, we were able to get the corresponding message type. The table below has these results for the first 5 customers. "

Now, we are attempting to find the average expected profit if the messages are offered at random to all the customers. To determine this, we took a new random assignment approach, by assigning each customer a new `to_offer_rnd` message type. Taking this final offered message, and the respective expected profit for the specified message type, we created a new `target_rnd` column with the expected profits by offering these randomized messages. Using this, the average expected profit was calculated, similar to Q5 above."

   "source": [
    "#### Strengths we see in this new policy:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The policy will work well in targeting customers who frequent Pentathlon to buy sporting equipment from one or two departments, such as youth sports coaches and multi-sport high school athletes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses we see in this new policy:\n",
    "\n",
    "> This type of targeted mailing seems will be ineffective in allocating promotional e-mails to the varying departments and will likely result in customer fatigue for those receiving similar e-mails over the course of three weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In addition to this, if we think about the people who purchase items from a sporting goods store, it is more likely that they will make one big purchase item from a department and not have to return to that section for some time. For example, someone might purchase a surfboard from the water sports department, or a new baseball bat and glove from the team section for the new season. It is unlikely that these consumers, which we feel would be the majority, would return to the same department week after week. The use of targeting messages would be redundant if they have already been to the department for what they needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our suggestions for improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We would recommend that instead of doing the analysis monthly, it should be done bi-weekly (every other week of the month) so that the customer will not be irritated in receiving targeted messages from departments they had interacted with a month ago.    \n",
    "\n",
    "> Our second recommendation is that if a customer has already interacted with and purchased a product in the department of the message that would maximize their probability of purchase, we would suggest that the next message be substituted with the second or third highest for the next round that month. In doing so, the customer will not be sent a message from a department that they had just purchased an item from. Effectively, in a given month, once a customer has actually interacted with a message type, they will not see another message from this department. Instead, we suggest sending them a message from a department that they have not yet purchased an item from but are likely to. We see this as a way for Pentathlon to build the customers interest in a different department and encourage them to return.\n"
